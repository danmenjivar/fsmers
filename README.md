# [FSM Learning Tool](https://fsmlearningtool.netlify.app)

by [Daniel Menjivar](https://danmenjivar.com) & Kyle Guieb - *Class of 2020*

[FSM Learning Tool](linkhereplease) helps you design, draw, and test Deterministic Finite Automatons (DFA's) & some Non-deterministic Finite Automatons (NFA's). [Finite State Machines](https://brilliant.org/wiki/finite-state-machines/)  are a staple in computer science theory. This tool is designed to help you, students & educators alike, explore and conceptualize FSM's from the comfort of your web browser using click-and-drag actions. Once you're done designing your FSM, head on over to the testing environment, where entire batches of strings can quickly be simulated on your design. We encourage you to tinker with your designs and explore the power of regular languages that simple machines like these provide.
